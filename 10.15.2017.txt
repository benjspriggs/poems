// 10.15.17
Today was the dry run of the Bicentennary celebration and I'm more certain now that my kids are either not going to do stage stuff or something because that is very taxing on the soul, and can grow a sense of unworthiness rather quickly. Lots of energy. Speaking of, I'm also super drained, so an early night will do me some good.
All the stuff I do is difficult but not impossible. I need to make sure to ask for help and draw on God's assistance.
I'm wanting to retreat to somewhere quiet now, which is good. Life is good right now. Thank God.

all this work is
difficult, but not
impossible - as it
may try to present fear
in the shape of
unworthiness and dread
know that these tests
address themselves to
exactly who you need
to be, to yourself
and to others, so
i love you and
keep working, because
you are beautiful
and the work shows
your beauty

//
i'll need to
get to know
this sense of
unease being me
because if i
can address it
properly, it will
show me a new
more accepting life

//
i never imagined
a wall be more
loving than
another's gaze,
the secrets
borne in my own
heart be retold
by reflections
on a lazy sunday

//
about to tip a vase
the child looks to the parent
waiting for their attentive gaze
we are and are run by
these children, whose
scars and bruises live
and dreams enact
in the supreme dream

//
how do i really feel?
without a gaze or
pair of ears waiting to
hear what i say
if in the end of nothing
the space unfolds us
and asks us one last question:
how do you really feel?

// to my followers
i wonder
how many of you
are really listening
to this ball-point pen
if these words are like
the thousands of others
that wash over, through
the day and its demands
do i comfort?
encourage? liberate?
empathize? decorate?
i don't know
but if this is something
that is good to you,
please enjoy,
because good needs enjoying
and the spirit that
tells us who or what
to love and cherish
only comes to us willingly
when we've done the work
to accept them

//
her tooth came out
she's longer than i
had taken time to
really consider the
fact of her,
the height of the
mountains she climbs
as she too is guided
by love

//
our day is the
surface of a lake
the sun glinting and
gleaming off it,
we only see reflections
of what's deeper,
what's in our hearts
and in our fates
and the two levels
make up the unknowable us,
but just enough to
give the curiosity for
calmer days

// bedroom
these four corners here
bear my life, it feels
like the opening paragraph
of a new novel,
describing the birth
of the things that
will fill the
pages to come next

// arizona dream
joonam, you
give my breath
an electric charge
and my heart is
sent into space,
attempting to
contemplate
the stars in your eyes

//
i wish i had
some compact wisdom
on the path of learning
the power of the heart
the process of listening
and getting to know
the primal and infinite
power from that source
emptied from desire
and filled with dreams
i really wish i did
but it seems like
i still need to
climb this hill
to get a better vista

// quandry for a treat
popsacle
pocksickle
pawtickle
pa- ugh
treat?

//
i didn't think
we would live
to have foreign treats
like oreos and cocacola
in the tall glass
looking foreign among
the gluten-free cookbooks
and disdain for processed sugar

//
i love to hear
your pure intent,
even as you insist
your own mistakes
it is the essence
that can never
be taken, because
it always takes itself back

//
i wonder what
metaphor waits
for the punctuations
of moments of life
by explosive transportation
from one field to
the next, whisked
and beating the limits of legs
