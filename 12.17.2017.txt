Time marches on. So does impostor syndrome. Can't ever seem to shake it, so I'm going to reflect on it.
It feels like I can either be good at computers or at music, never both at the same time. My first instinct is to say that it's from the fact of both them prioritize different parts of my competencies. One to analysis and comprehension, another for intuition. I'm seeing and using them as opposite poles of cognition.
Comp Sci/dev work is creative, music contains transcription & analysis. Breaking down that barrier is important.
I'm nervous, scared, feel alone even though I know I'm not. I'm scared I'm not valuable or will be found out as someone incompetent at my crafts, as I feel I am. I feel stuck between professional and amateur, between someone that does and someone that does not. My music feels disconnected, my practice is inconsistent. My code feels small and insignificant. I feel small.
I acknowledge these fears and intent to at least warm up and clean myself up before heading out. In truth, must no one gives a shit about what I do, & I don't care about the majority of players on the market. I will spend my diligence presenting myself modestly & realistically, and attempt to see others in a generous and honest light.
I'm not going to be able to solve it tonight, but I can take steps to improve a day from now.

Yeah, so I did get to see Charles & play with the "in" crowd. They are and are not my crowd. Definitely know now that my choice to pursue a life adjacent to that was a good decision. Would have been frustrated by high expectations very quickly and frequently. My life has to have a process of playing good music for joy's sake to be able to feel fulfilled in my skills and talents.
I've started the proving yesterday, took a little video. I'm certain homeopathy is ritualized placebo at this point, but that brings into question my motives and my intention behind the proving. Will I change my belief around it if it works? I have negative connotations around it, and have been previously convinced it doesn't work, but who knows, I didn't have the same intuition starting it yesterday. Definitely a "proving" it wrong. I must detach from both for my quest to be successful. Can a treatment work independent of the belief of it?
Today I am feeling like I want to make a road map of my career and passion, so that I don't spend as much energy on deciding where to go next. That will be good.
So NWEA. My last lunch the team forgot to invite me and they didn't realize until they were out the door. Summarizes their work ethic and team spirit. On to Tripwire. On to be a working man.

200C 12/10 - Feelings of not being able to receive love. Not inadequacy, but wanting to feel worthy of it.

"If you touch my butt, I tickle".

So this week was wonderful. Passed in a second. Coming in on Friday and leaving Saturday, every day filled with cuddles, intimacy, vulnerability, adventure, fun, love, laughter, tears, the whole deal. And a LOT of good meals. Perfect, amazing, beautiful. Unconditional love is wonderful.
First night we cuddled and caught up and stared into each others' eyes. (Assume that if there's a stretch of undescribed time, it was filled with cuddles like these). Saturday was the day of no plan, and we ended up sleeping early enough Friday we went to walk on the beach at 5 AM. Came in, snuggled, had breakfast. Massages and whatnot (more like what-hot-ness). Sunday was the parent's & Bayan. Neda wants me to call her Neda Joon. Cute. Shared the family Snarky Puppy which was wonderful. Monday Shereen had a late morning the last day she needed to be up on break, for the last missed blood draw for the quarter. She nailed it in one. Cuddled after that.
Later that day was the meetup which went well. Felt valuable. Tuesday was Elmar & Allison's B-day. Elmar was a little much & we had a moment after to check in with the fact that we are different people. The party was chill & I got complemented on my arms. More cuddling. Wednesday was Leavenworth. Cute 2-5pm excursion. Night of 4 orgasms. Great head. Thursday was the parent night, ended up leaving later than we wanted to originally, so we had a cozy duo dinner. This was the Snarky Puppy night, actually. Friday was Pike's Place market, Bayan & bros, grocery shopping, and a feeling of being loved. Saturday was last minute cuddles & talking/ vulnerability.
A great first honeymoon. Certainly sounded like one to the neighbors.
I know I love Shereen more & can trust that love more b/c of this week. We had many opportunities to become frustrated & mad at each other, not connecting & feeling vengeful at the other, but we didn't. We spent time with our emotions & each other to the point that we can open up a zone of vulnerability, know that it will still be there, and will be respected. We respect & pamper each other a lot, love is flowing easily from us both.
It's a unique experience, & I'm happy to say that I'm taking as much of it in as I can, as it happens.
I love Shereen so much. She truly is the love that will define my life.

stingy bus seats
firm but irradiated
with a sense of
calm & surrender,
the feeling of
being in love &
being in-love-d
is more magic
than any natural science

my love simply
is radiant,
the focus of
so many poems
& many more to come

a blank page
still stares at
my grim face
the same as it has
but now the
little black and blue
slivers and skitters
make themselves more
easily known to me
on the page as poems
rather than just being
in my eye, as
I squeeze them blearily
on a cold, silent night

often I wish
there were extra

for me to ponder
