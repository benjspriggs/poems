Wow, so another knot of feelings.
First week of internship & classes, that was relatively relaxed requirement wise & work wise. I am intending on doing a lot of the offloading so that I can not get swamped midterms week.
Planning my honeymoon w/ Shereen, along with a bit of the wedding & I see how non-specific I felt about pretty much all of the places. What do I want out of the honeymoon? Time alone & a good bed. Most anywhere satisfied it (along w/ it being made special somehow) and none of the pictures were like specifically to me being like "wow, this is it!". I don't know. I know that I want to focus again on what the trip does have & not what it will lack, b/c there will always be something missing.
I also need to get the engagement ring situation figured out, and I need to practice for the week (yikes, should fix that for next week). I'm nervous that I know literally nothing about anything & this is a agood chunk of money. I need to do some wholesale, focused research or just try and fail a few times. God can just direct me and point me in the right direction, I just need to show up.
My heart is dogged with the fear that I'm not enough, that I'm making the wrong mistakes, or that I won't be able to satisfy everyone this term. I am capable and if I treat myself well I can do amazing things by the grace of God. I can make mistakes & finding the right ones to make is part of the process. Learning comes when I allow it all to happen & I reflect on what I'm doing daily, rather than when it's most convenient. Pleasing everyone is going to be impossible, I need to either have my own goals or limit the number of people I want to please. My goals this term:
	- Create material for release with RP & my own stuff
	- Maintain or practice habit
	- Reflect daily
	- Poems daily
	- Maintain & nurture my health
	- School req's (>3.7 GPA per term)
	- Start & get things mostly done for thesis
	- Book wedding stuff
	- Have ring & engagement announcement
	- Prepare myself adequately for next term

Might be good to have these on a paper or some other daily spot. I'll need focus on them to maintain progress & a steady advance.
I reflected today because I was feeling uneasy about marrying Shereen, which was a major part of why I need to continuously revisit myself. If time with her is not enjoyable, then I need to spend more time with myself. Acceptance & peace will come from within, prompted by the right forces & work done to attract them.
I also notice that I have a compulsion to be erotic when I normally wouldn't because I want to prove how much I enjoy Shereen, and if I'm not able to ejaculate every time/ night, then I feel the fear of "oh no, the attraction thing was mandatory, we really can't be together" which isn't true but feels true in my weaker moments.
There was an interesting feeling walking from honor's college to the lab of empowerment, determination, invincibility & anxiety that widened my stride & puffed out my chest. I feel divinely inspired? Something that either is that or is masquerading as it. I feel powerful, in those moments.
I need to check into my heart more frequently.

my love has called
and my dreams have
met me at the station
traveling to this new
and exciting land
#love #called #exciting
#new journeys 
// like sand
a million details
and a spirit of
obsession, perfection
in the first try
can inspire the lover,
thirsty after this love
to miss them, instead
counting the sand, like blessings

I'm mad at myself for having feelings that prevented intimacy from happening with Shereen tonight. She keeps saying that my heart is her priority, but my heart is not my priority. I don't see as much what happens to it, I don't want to hurt or feel selfish for wanting things I'm not logically supposed to want or have. My heart feels trampled and ignored. I feel let down & disappointed in my harness for not holding me up again. I need to write every day, definitely.

my gash is deep
but ignored, like
I've made a life
building bridges over it -
it's here to stay
and I've assumed
that all I'll know
is life above, not life without

my early night
is my pride -
my source of
joy abiding

// new things form
don't try to stem the flow
of life, as it will go
what happens now will happen again
until the lesson or moral is said
never clearly, never as we might
expect a beam of light
we see the thunderstorm
and are told to see what
new things form

Not the best time but I need to acknowledge this - my gash is significantly impacting my life. Has significantly impacted my life. My own feeling of not being someone interesting or "in" the in-group has shaped my needs & demeanors & goals & life quite significantly. God willing it's in a good direction. I'm frustrated I don't give myself regular enough time to work on my most significant wound, the thing I've been afraid to really open up because I feel it's going to debilitate me in a major way.
My heart hurts thinking about this. I've used this to connect, to bridge my connections with people, but I wish I didn't have this thing with me. At least, not right now. I wish it was used in a different way maybe, I wish (sometimes) that it was easier to be around people, to enjoy social settings ...
Hold on. I've not ever nor will ever (in a majority of settings) be energized by people. I need to find a way to minimally enjoy company for a significant amount of time with people. I've always beeen more inwardly recharged. My gash isn't this.
Specifically, my gash opened up around not inviting many people & feeling obligated to invite ISGP people to the ceremony, Zac/Lee etc kinds of people that are around me frequently but not close in that way. Why do I not want to have a small ceremony? I don't want to seem lonely. I'm introverted, why don't I want to seem lonely, I'm not someone that keeps many deep relationships - what's the difference? I'm more concerned about appearances. Why? Because I'm not decided on my actual guest list.

i've had it backwards
for a time,
i think it's that
you need to make
even before you've
woken up to the world
(exchanging dreams)
you need to
hear the morning's whisper
as it is imprinted
silently, overnight
on your heart

the dream I've had
of a room full of
happy & content people,
smiling at me, their
progenetor and their
first stop on their journey
of life, where I've had
the distinct joy of
knowing where we come from --
it inspires my writing
for the right time
for every thing to be done
so I can know
that room is waiting
and my journey
has it as it's
last stop

my mind my reality,
me imagining my imagination
& my imaginitive disappearances
into my own dreams
i think too much of
my fear of aggrandisement
has led me to the
incorrect conclusion -
my imagination
is not mine, is
an amalgam &
product of experiences
& to search in others
for the meaning i look
is better than
not looking at all

it's something else
to feel effort
come pouring out
spilling over the page
experience the seeing

all in one graceful step
and what gets me
is the thought after
the effort spilled -
seeing how it looks
and understanding
how it waas already
spent, but now
made beautiful with trust

a dream, now
witnessed by my
own nonchalance,
broken-down jeer
and fear that,
even now, we see
my own ineptitude
leak through my coolness -
this is my struggle
my push into uncertainty
& fear confronted
to meet my own love
my own passion, locked
behind words i say
to myself in greenrooms
& walking up those
too-bright steps
