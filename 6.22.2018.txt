// 11 2.1.18 compute
magic, these
sysems of interlocked
ideas, chewing
up our own time

//
hearts are gardens
neding the regular
water of unconditional
love

// 12 2.3.18
love is a blessing
that descends when
all other layers of
yourself have peeled away

//
here's to hope
proliferating with intent
to dreams being
things we live with

// 13 2.4.18
my dream, one day
to be in company
that speaking my mind
is not so foreign

//
who's world is this?

// 13 2.22.18
hope is much more
resulient, than
i was expecting -
flowing is the shape
that lasts ater
mountains wear down

//
my dream
my love has
been opened
& presented
for love's sake

// 14 2.23.18 gifts
i've spent a lot of
time thinking on
the ways my life
could go -
that's a gift,
but now the
present needs to
be unwrapped
in order to
enjoy
this wonderful gift

// my light
i've spent my life
chasing after light
where it leads me
sunset after sunset
an the colors of
the maroon-purple
frosty honeymoon sunset
remind me
of the brghtness
of the radiance
& of the joy you
attract & spread in life
reminds me
that i chase light
and you, my love
are the brightest light i've chased
and makes me
continue to need
your light in my life
for the rest, & on & on

// 15 3.7.18
trickling frustration
like a leaky roof
of a self-made
cabin meant for winter
what I thought
was secure, was
open to the elements
and my oversaturated expectations

// drawstrings
stiff body, unwound
I have found my
own drawstrings,
like magic, freed

// 16 3.21.18
not scared i made
a wrong choice, more
scared that the change
overwrites my confidence

//
nowhere to be
& nothing to do
such wonderful
pastimes of reflection

//
i have these defenses
of my solitude, against
invaders of social outing
and parties of acquaintences
they've been up since
i've had to submit
to attendance, to
and overwhelm of people
none of them too much
but taken in high dosage
much grater than my tolerance
for my disappeared space

//
not quite as flowery
as i'd like, as i'd
convinced myself
a poet of flowers
my writing is more
like fertilized dirt -
where the wind may,
flowers be,
and not where the
dirt wishes to be beautiful

//
good writing is
an accident
repeated until
it never stops happening

//
didn't know
it could work,
that any of this
could even come
but my dreams
have been unlikely trials
at discovering what
strange things reality does

//
i'm out of time
for many reasons,
i speak for
large chunks
at a time,
and my
will to say no
falters, like my step
as my burden
is loaded by curiosity

//
dreams,
my connection
to something
less practical

//
my heart wishes
not for control
but the serenity
of control, surrounding

//
this is just
my vaguebooking
just more fancy
& hipster

// 18 4.19.18 i would have no words
my heart is
in a million places,
scattered through
time & faces
through idle nothings
spent easily & quickly
to moments written
with my blood, on my soul
my heart of ink
writing pages through
a life lived fruitfully
and action spent cautiously
and to think that
i would have no words

//
dreams are
metaphor,
whispered under
reality's breath
to get ya
to see the point

//
pain is the animal
that cries out
fom the depths
of humanity

//
anything goes here -
im' not so picky
as to deliver masterpiece
by c-section

//
family is a
story told well
that surrounds us
by choice or by blood -
i'm thinking of the
many times a story
gets re-told & re-
imagined over time
and grows up with you,
the family drama maturing
like a cousin, barely seen
& distinct each time

// why write
i wrote because
my demons took my words
and my world shrank
to their mist
i wondered & wrote
because my dremons took
my eyes & vision
obscuring fantasy
the goodsense of imagination
my demons still
linger here, in
the heat that still
wanders the world,
but there are
sunny days
& brighter viions
of my life
but i stil write
to sho my respect
to the demons that
gave me new words
to the demons that
gave my eyes new
clarity & focus -
i write, so that
battels would never
fade from
my being

//
i'm wondering
what, if anything
i might be
known for
i've put so much
effort into dreaming
my fame & notoriety
not so much working
but giving me
the sensaion of
importance, justified
to only myself
i'm wnting to
just let life be
putting my effort
into things that matter
and my thoughts
there - but
still I wan
that dream
of being thought of
& thoroughly

//
lonliness is my theme
solitude my steed
i need a better story
this one sucks

//
"belong nowhere"
was an idea I
realized quickly
that you don't
realize it quickly
life teaches it
and teaches it
over and over
to attentive students
takes the pride of
knowing it
and replaces it
with true humility
of needing it again,
just one more time

// ana
i never think i
let people in
accidentaly,
as a matter of chance
i imagine my
guards up like moats
cocentric levels of
isolation & mysery
but my gates have
been lowered very
few times in my life
& i'm always seemingly
in need of new company
so a visit becomes
a much longer stay
thatn either of us
could have guessed
what i'm saying is that
i need fewer moats
and better friends
and more changes to
let people in
but i also need
time to myself
& a trust be tween
me, me, & God
and you've helped
me see that,
many times over
so thanks
for the journal,
& the many steps
you've seen me
walk, slowly
to my goal
of a
well-lived ilfe
