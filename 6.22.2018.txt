that speaking my mind

flowing is the shape
that lasts after

i've spent a lot of
time thinking on
the ways my life
could go -
that's a gift,
but now the
present needs to
be unwrapped
in order to
enjoy
this wonderful gift

// my light
i've spent my life
chasing after light
where it leads me
sunset after sunset
and the colors of
the maroon-purple
frosty honeymoon sunset
remind me
of the brightness
of the radiance
& of the joy you
attract & spread in life
reminds me
that i chase light
and you, my love
are the brightest light i've chased
and makes me
continue to need
your light in my life
for the rest, & on & on

trickling frustration
like a leaky roof
of a self-made
cabin meant for winter
what I thought
was secure, was
open to the elements
and my oversaturated expectations

a wrong choice, more

i have these defenses
of my solitude, against
invaders of social outing
and parties of acquaintances
they've been up since
i've had to submit
to attendance, to
and overwhelm of people
none of them too much
but taken in high dosage
much grater than my tolerance
for my disappeared space

not quite as flowery
as i'd like, as i'd
convinced myself
a poet of flowers
my writing is more
like fertilized dirt -
where the wind may,
flowers be,
and not where the
dirt wishes to be beautiful

good writing is
an accident
repeated until
it never stops happening

didn't know
it could work,
that any of this
could even come
but my dreams
have been unlikely trials
at discovering what
strange things reality does
#to my love #love #life

//
i'm out of time
for many reasons,
i speak for
large chunks
at a time,
and my
will to say no
falters, like my step
as my burden
is loaded by curiosity

my connection

// 18 4.19.18 i would have no words
my heart is
in a million places,
scattered through
time & faces
through idle nothings
spent easily & quickly
to moments written
with my blood, on my soul
my heart of ink
writing pages through
a life lived fruitfully
and action spent cautiously
and to think that
i would have no words
#some moments just take your words away

dreams are
metaphor,
whispered under
reality's breath

family is a
story told well
that surrounds us
by choice or by blood -
i'm thinking of the
many times a story
gets re-told & re-
imagined over time
and grows up with you,
the family drama maturing
like a cousin, barely seen
& distinct each time
#family #sometimes there some wack stuff that just happens
#and you find out 20 years later

// why write
i wrote because
my demons took my words
and my world shrank
to their mist
i wondered & wrote
because my demons took
my eyes & vision
obscuring fantasy
the good sense of imagination
my demons still
linger here, in
the heat that still
wanders the world,
but there are
sunny days
& brighter visions
of my life
but i still write
to show my respect
to the demons that
gave me new words
to the demons that
gave my eyes new
clarity & focus -
i write, so that
battles would never
fade from
my being
#creativity

i'm wondering
what, if anything
i might be
known for
i've put so much
effort into dreaming
my fame & notoriety
not so much working
but giving me
the sensation of
importance, justified
to only myself
i'm wanting to
just let life be
putting my effort
into things that matter
and my thoughts
there - but
still I wan
that dream
of being thought of
& thoroughly

//
loneliness is my theme
solitude my steed
i need a better story
this one sucks
#self #thoughts #anxiety

"belong nowhere"
was an idea I
realized quickly
that you don't
realize it quickly
life teaches it
and teaches it
over and over
to attentive students
takes the pride of
knowing it
and replaces it
with true humility
of needing it again,
just one more time

i never think i
let people in
accidentally,
as a matter of chance
i imagine my
guards up like moats
cocentric levels of
isolation & mystery
but my gates have
been lowered very
few times in my life
& i'm always seemingly
in need of new company
so a visit becomes
a much longer stay
that either of us
could have guessed
what i'm saying is that
i need fewer moats
and better friends
and more changes to
let people in
but i also need
time to myself
& a trust be tween
me, me, & God
and you've helped
me see that,
many times over
so thanks
for the journal,
& the many steps
you've seen me
walk, slowly
to my goal
of a
well-lived life
