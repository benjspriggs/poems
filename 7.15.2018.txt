you, my dream
my heart of
a thousand
good nights
spent wishing
for eternity
small minutes
to continue
in this trance
#to my love #love #dreaming #dreams

and ending in the same
wisdom being the only

my name is unknown
written in the scroll,
hidden at birth
& revealed in its
fullness at death
opening of nothingness
closing the book &
revealing all unknown
because there's no known -
my name is there
written in stars long
& far-off dead things
their light quantified
from infinite things

hidden lights
two visions are
the only window
to full reality
worlds a slight
adjustment of perspective
away from us,
from eyes & minds
who have lost their
home in this
confusing whirlwind
of dust

the myth of life
is the great
joke to tell yourself
when it asserts itself
just a little too
strongly
#jokes #life #life is weird

//
dreams are dreams
themselves contained
in their own story
& their on logic
reality is reality ...
#nothing is real #it's all an illusion

// quilted
my love is me -
the quintessential
thread & fabric
of reality
i am woven from
many disparate strands
woven, quilted
from the come-together
parts of the world
that need that
quilted warmth

//
all of belonging
my themes revolve
around that
idea of belonging
this sense of
home-ness outside
of home, with
certain people of
places I wish to be
and experience, but
never have the
heart to enter
people I never quite
have the heart to
ask, "do you want
to belong with me?"

so many dimensions
to the small &
simpler parts of life -
we take for granted
that our dust is ours
& it is understood

the answers to questions
one learns, must be
questions, since
to answer requires
the life of "I know"

my hint that
i was ready for
love came along
when my dream
ended while my
eyes were open

Here is the
light of my life --
in the forever of
my heart
#to my love #living #life

// 6 6.19.18
my love is eternal
our promise is written
in every old book
and word to be spoken
#love #promises #life #living

// freedom
i know what it's like
to be free, it's
the breath held
exhaled forever
the spending of
what you keep
inside, forever
outside of yourself

i have so far
yet to go,
i feel with
the tips of
my own fingers,
widest reach
of my own imagination
how i could be
and it frustrates
my own pride,
awakens
my own anger,
inspires
my every oment
to sit wondering
at what could be
#thoughts #so far to go
