i think i get
mad at myself
for not practicing
or reaching far
because that's
been my life -
recognition &
love attached
to my reach
to my skills
& talents, that
quite honestly
should get used to
this new age
of radical
love, unattached
#love #self-acceptance
#self love #positivity
#self esteem

//
i am free!
of words that
bind the heart
that sings -
my cage is just
dust, gravel
and my voice
is eternal

sometimes my
jaw locks up
from the sheer
rage that comes
or tries to,
out of my mouth
like rivers of lava
destruction & heat -
this is the recipe
for an eruption,
creativity through
unmaking restraint
exploding comments
held back, & now
more powerful
& dangerous than ever

rage is new
& old, it
comes in
the same form
repeatedly
to different
stimuli

expecting greatness
routinely disappointed
when in fact,
we see where it springs
in daily routine
boring details
eventually coalescing
into divine work

//
there's the
little me,
scared to
write anything
scared that
ink will spill
and mystery
give way
to just
me, myself
in my humanity
& ability to fail -
to this me
i must remind
with this pen
in my hand,
that all is done
a little a day
and that
the ink already spilled
to reveal
your own heart
#writing #creativity
#little me

//
an expectation
free of expectation
the seed of hope
along with death
disappointment
tempered with life
life
tempered with peace

joy is quite
fun to chase -
make a hobby
or a lifetime of it

my joy

what closes
my jaw?
holds my tongue
when words
they need saying
they need
expressing
beyond my limits
#frustration #self reflection
#self

// just lucky
it's never supposed to be
perfect like this
not everything is
supposed to line up
& be this tidy
my mind, which
i've followed for
a good long while
is confused
by this circumstance
that always seems
to turn good
& rewarding in the end
this life of blessing
will not be forgotten
& ignored, like
some comfortable socks
this blessing will
continue beyond me
& as it falls, know
that i'm just lucky
#generosity #blessings #abundance
#gratitude

//
i'm thinking
about words
to say
then,
but honestly
i can't see
what poetry
might write itself
for me

// 12 7.14.2018 - breath
it's all
about breath
how it gets
stored in
your body,
your mind,
your will
how it expands
from your lungs
to today
& tomorrow

// mirrors
how much i
trust myself
the little society
of ego for ego
reflects the
bigger society,
& it reflects
me, on & on

it's only worth it
to promote healthy ideas
& not immortalize sick ones,
except as vaccines
#sickness #mental health

breath is
the steed
your will
travels on

frustration
is the place
i am simultaneously
freed from
& trapped in,
hemming my
range of motion
to a small square
instead of
that large, open field
#living #life #frustration
#anxiety #depression #mental health

//
fear is
jealous of
happiness, it
reviles joy
beats it
back in to
that dark place
where fear is born
but like all
very good things
scattering light
only brightens
the deepest shadows
