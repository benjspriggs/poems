Shereen Khorami.
I wanted to have words for when we started our beautiful forever together. I wanted for something that would mark the beginning of an eternity of love, of sacrifice, of generosity, of blessings, of thankfulness and of tests. I wanted to demonstrate in those kinds of ways what kind of person I am and what kind of person I would be.
I'm not sure how or when these words are going to get to you, but God will make sure they do at the right time. He has a way of doing things like that.
I want to express how thankful I am as well, even if I'm not good at showing it at times, of us and how we came togehter and continue to be together. Your experience and incredible wisdom, kindness, generosity, graciousness, gracefulness, beauty, eagerness, curiosity, pure-heartedness and life are things I do not take for granted - they are bounties to me and to everyone that is around you. I thank God for you, for making you.
I'm fond of making light or ignoring key facts of life up until they confront me, much like anyone else. I've been fond to do this out of habit, out of the life that surrounds me and teaches me how to survive and flourish in it. Your overflowing kindness and generosity, seemed to me, like something out of life, like a magical alternate dimension where the good qualities of people ae rewarded and the order of life is good. Despite the world, you still choose to exist and move in it with a love and joy that I can't explain, beyond that it is you that has been directly helped by God in your life, and that you wish to help others in a similar way.
You keep amazing friends, continue to find generous and curious people like yourself that also find ways to brave the life that God sends each of us - the life that tests us to our capacity and no more, the life that bends and shapes us into things that are able to become detatched from a world of shapes. You bring a world of beautiful things into existence.
I believe this world of shapes is a song. Notes, chords, rhythms, beats, all made from a frequency of love. I see a beautiful song in you, with you, because of you. I hope to join in, at least for a verse or two. Nothing would bring my heart more joy.
